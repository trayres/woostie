This experiment sets up a system controller which acts as a bridge between the 
signal bus and the node hierarchy - this allows the controller to do things like
update the UI layer and receive events from the system bus.

This is also where we'll be putting other "system control" type things - simple
state machines for controlling multipart actions, etc. 

As of right now the event bus/controller stuff works, the other part will be ported
on later.
